## Automated-Audio-to-video-lip-synchronization
# The project is aimed at helping people to listen to conferences, lectures or movies in another spoken 
# Language by syncing the dubbed input audio with the target video.
#  Models
We developed a complete translation system starting from text in a language to video in another 
 language (e.g English to Arabic).
 o Integrated Wav2Vec model to extract transcript from the input audio.
 o Integrated translation APIs like (Google, Microsoft) to translate text then generating audio from 
 that text to supply to the lip sync module.
 o Integrated text to speech model to generate natural voice to be as input voice to the lip sync 
 module.
# Accuracy
Achieved high accuracy in lip sync and demonstrated the system's ability to sync any input language to 
    the target video based on audio features.
